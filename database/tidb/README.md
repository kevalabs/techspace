## ‚ùì What is TiDB?

[TiDB](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb) is an open-source, distributed SQL database built to support both OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) workloads. It offers MySQL compatibility, horizontal scalability, and strong consistency with high availability out of the box.

- Hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP)
- Compatible with MySQL protocols
- Built-in horizontal scalability
- Distributed transactions using Raft and MVCC
- Separation of storage and compute

## üê≤ Why TiDB?

We chose **TiDB** to power systems that require:

* High **concurrent connection handling**
* Effortless **horizontal scaling** for growth
* Support for both **transactional (OLTP)** and **analytical (OLAP)** queries
* Built-in **fault tolerance** and **high availability**
* Simplified infrastructure for fast-moving teams

TiDB offers the flexibility to start small ‚Äî even with a single node ‚Äî and evolve into a fully distributed, cloud-native architecture as demand increases.

## üåö TiDB vs PostgreSQL ‚Äì Practical Trade-offs

| Feature/Concern               | PostgreSQL (Standalone)                         | TiDB (Single Node or Clustered)                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Connections Handling**      | Requires connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer)   | Built-in, stateless SQL layer handles high concurrency  |
| **Horizontal Scaling (OLTP)** | Manual sharding or complex extensions needed    | Native support through distributed TiKV + PD            |
| **OLAP Support**              | Add-ons (e.g., Citus) or external tools needed  | OLAP support is built-in and SQL-compliant              |
| **High Availability**         | Requires additional setup (e.g., Patroni, Etcd) | Built-in with automatic leader election and replication |
| **Storage Engine**            | Single-node, monolithic                         | Distributed, Raft-based key-value store                 |
| **Operational Overhead**      | Low for basic use; high for HA and scale        | Simplified scaling and resilience with cluster mode     |
| **Deployment (Single Node)**  | Very lightweight                                | Heavier footprint but suitable for small-scale setup    |
| **Backup/Restore**            | pg\_dump / pg\_basebackup                       | Fast, parallelized backup/restore via BR tool           |
| **Open Source License**       | PostgreSQL License                              | Apache 2.0 (Community Edition)                          |

## üöÄ Ideal Use Cases for TiDB

TiDB is well-suited for:

* Applications expecting **organic growth** in data or users
* Systems with **spiky or sustained high concurrency**
* Platforms needing **OLTP and OLAP** support from a unified engine
* Engineering teams seeking to **minimize operational complexity** while planning for future scale
